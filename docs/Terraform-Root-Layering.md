# Terraform Root Layering

Company-agnostic methodology for deciding when Terraform resources belong in one
root and when to split them into a new root. It pairs with the
[methodology](./Terraform-Agent-Development-Methodology.md) and
[testing](./Terraform-Testing.md) docs. Each infra repo adds a thin overlay
(`docs/runbooks/Terraform-Root-Layering.runbook.md`) that lists only its own
current roots, state prefixes, and apply-role boundaries.

## Root Metadata

Every managed root under `terraform/<provider>/<environment>` must include a
`metadata.json`. The shared `terraform/ci/terraform-ci-matrix` reads it and fails
closed if it is missing or inconsistent (schema:
[`terraform/ci/metadata.schema.json`](../terraform/ci/metadata.schema.json)).

Required fields:

- `state_key`: exact S3 backend key for the root.
- `state_sensitivity`: either `standard` or `sensitive`.
- `backend_config_file`: backend HCL file consumed by CI and operator commands.
- `provider_allowlist`: exact provider sources allowed after Terranix render.
- `credential_mode`: how CI obtains provider credentials.
- `enable_checkov`: whether the reusable CI workflow should run Checkov.
- `split_boundary`: human-readable lifecycle and access-boundary rationale.

The metadata is deliberately redundant with the backend file. The backend file
drives OpenTofu; the metadata drives review and CI matrix generation.

## State Classes

Standard roots use:

```text
terraform/<provider>/<environment>.tfstate
```

Sensitive roots use:

```text
terraform-sensitive/<provider>/<environment>.tfstate
```

Use `sensitive` when a root stores provider-returned or generated secret
material in state, even if the state bucket is encrypted at rest. S3 encryption
protects stored bytes, but any principal with `s3:GetObject` permission can
receive decrypted state. IAM and OIDC role scope are therefore the real access
boundary.

## Split Criteria

Do not split a root only to make files smaller. Split when at least one of these
is true:

- A component needs a distinct state access boundary.
- A component stores provider-returned or generated secret material in state.
- A component has an independent lifecycle, promotion cadence, or rollback path.
- A component needs different provider credentials or a different apply role.
- A component can be planned and applied independently without ambiguous
  cross-root ordering.

When those criteria are not true, prefer a single root so OpenTofu keeps one
dependency graph, one lock, and one plan.

## Future Split Procedure

Before any stateful resources are moved:

1. Add or update the target root's `metadata.json`.
2. Add the backend file and CI matrix support.
3. Add offline Terranix/OpenTofu tests for the new root.
4. Freeze applies for the affected roots.
5. Move state with reviewed `tofu state mv` or import into the new backend.
6. Confirm the old root does not plan to destroy moved resources.
7. Confirm the new root does not plan to recreate moved resources.
8. Merge only after the PR plan comments match the intended no-destroy migration.

If the split introduces a new sensitive state prefix or a narrower apply role,
the bootstrap IAM change must be reviewed and applied by a human before the
credentialed CI path is enabled (Layer 0 — see the
[bootstrap runbook](./Terraform-Bootstrap-Runbook.md)).
