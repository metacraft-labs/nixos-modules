# `services.vm-harness-serve` — declarative `vm-harness serve` deployment

Campaign: *CI Runner Fleet — vm-harness Remoting, Central GARM, Capability
Pools* · milestone **RA2** (Linux/incus serve deployment).

`services.vm-harness-serve` runs the RA1 [`vm-harness
serve`](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/vm-harness/blob/dev/docs/serve.md)
remoting daemon as a hardened systemd service. It is the **uniform network
access point** that lets ONE central GARM's incus providers drive every Linux
host's containers remotely (campaign Phase B) — replacing the per-host GARM and
the `eph-linux-x64` capacity band-aid.

This is the GENERAL, company-agnostic machinery: it bakes in no host list, IPs,
or credentials. The concrete Metacraft instantiation (which hosts, which overlay
IPs, the agenix token ciphertext) lives in the private `infra` repo and only
consumes these options.

## What it provides

- A `vm-harness-serve.service` systemd unit running `vm-harness serve` as a
  dedicated system user (`vm-harness-serve`), in the `incus-admin` group so it
  can reach the incus socket, under the same hardening profile as the
  `services.garm` incus-strict posture (`ProtectSystem=strict`,
  `NoNewPrivileges`, empty capability bounding set, a `@system-service` syscall
  filter, `AF_INET`/`AF_INET6`/`AF_UNIX` only, …).
- The bearer token delivered out of the world-readable Nix store via systemd
  `LoadCredential` (`--auth-token-file %d/token`), sourced from an
  agenix-decrypted file.
- **Overlay-only reachability, enforced two ways at once:**
  1. the listener binds a single overlay (NetBird) address — never `0.0.0.0`
     (an assertion rejects the wildcard); and
  2. the port is opened on the overlay interface's firewall zone ONLY
     (`networking.firewall.interfaces.<iface>`), never the global firewall.
- Idle-cheap / scale-to-zero-friendly: a single accept loop, one connection at
  a time, no timers — an idle daemon costs ~nothing.

The daemon's single `vm-harness` binary already contains `serve`; the module
defaults `package` to this flake's vendored `vm-harness` package
(`packages/vm-harness`).

## Minimal use

```nix
{ config, ... }:
{
  imports = [ inputs.nixos-modules.modules.nixos.vm-harness-serve ];

  services.vm-harness-serve = {
    enable = true;
    listenAddress = "100.83.180.254";                        # this host's overlay IP
    authTokenFile = config.age.secrets."vm-harness-serve/token".path;
    backend = "incus";
    # overlayInterface defaults to "nb-default"; extraPackages/extraGroups
    # default to the incus package + incus-admin when incus is enabled.
  };
}
```

The host also needs a converged incus (bridge, storage pool, default profile,
the runner base image) — use `services.garm-incus-runner-host` for that.

## Minting the bearer token (agenix)

The token is a per-host agenix secret (same $TOKEN the central GARM's per-host
provider config uses). On the Metacraft hosts the declaration is
`mcl.secrets.services.vm-harness-serve.secrets.token`, whose ciphertext path
auto-derives to `machines/server/<host>/secrets/vm-harness-serve/token.age`:

```sh
nix eval --json --apply 'c: c.mcl.secrets.services.vm-harness-serve.recipients' \
  ".#nixosConfigurations.<host>.config" | jq -r '.[]' > recipients.txt
printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | age -R recipients.txt \
  -o machines/server/<host>/secrets/vm-harness-serve/token.age
```

Recipients are the host key plus the `devops` group (`mcl.secrets.extraKeys`),
so the ciphertext must be minted once per host.

## Gate

`checks/vmharness-serve-linux-deploy.nix` builds the nixosTest
**`t_vmharness_serve_linux_deploy`**: it boots a host with the module + in-guest
incus and a second controller node, then proves the deployment end to end — a
remote controller drives a real ephemeral incus container roundtrip
(launch → probe → destroy, no residue) over the authenticated endpoint; a
wrong/missing token is rejected; and the port is bound to the overlay address
only and is unreachable on the host's second (non-overlay) network.

```sh
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.t_vmharness_serve_linux_deploy   # no infra repo needed
```
