# Runner-Fleet-Capability-Pools-And-Remote-Driving campaign, milestone RA2.
#
# The `vm-harness` CLI/daemon binary (public toolkit, metacraft-labs/vm-harness).
# Its SINGLE binary already includes `vm-harness serve` — the RA1 remoting
# daemon (PR #25, merged on the `dev` branch) — so nothing separate needs
# building for the serve deployment; `services.vm-harness-serve` just packages
# this binary into a hardened systemd unit.
#
# This mirrors the upstream flake's own package derivation (a plain `nim c` of
# `src/vm_harness/cli.nim`, plus the guest-scripts/guest-recipes payload) and is
# VENDORED here — exactly like `garm-provider-vmharness` — rather than pulled in
# as a flake input. A flake input would drag vm-harness's own (heavy)
# `nixos-modules` input tree into THIS repo's flake.lock (vm-harness follows
# nixos-modules for nixpkgs), so vendoring keeps the lock small and builds the
# binary against this repo's own nixpkgs.
#
# Bump `rev`/`hash` to roll the serve binary forward; the mainline is `dev`.
