# Runner-Fleet-Capability-Pools-And-Remote-Driving RE3/RE4 — package
# cloudbase/garm-provider-aws, GARM's official EC2 external provider, for NixOS.
# It provisions ephemeral EC2 runners (`--ephemeral` one-job auto-terminate) and
# is the AWS BURST tier of the fleet: the central GARM spills to it, via a lower
# pool `--priority`, only when the on-prem hosts are saturated, keeping a small
# always-warm floor (`min-idle-runners`).
#
# Packaged like `garm` (fetchFromGitHub + `vendorHash = null`): the upstream
# vendors ALL of its Go deps in-tree (`vendor/` + `vendor/modules.txt`), incl.
# the AWS SDK v2, so the build is fully offline. Pure Go — no cgo.
#
# SPOT PATCH PROVENANCE (Apache-2.0). Upstream garm-provider-aws launches
# ON-DEMAND instances only: its extra-specs schema (internal/spec/spec.go) has
# NO spot / InstanceMarketOptions field (verified against `main` @ 5df254e4).
# `patches/0001-add-spot-instance-market-options.patch` is a Metacraft Labs
# downstream patch that adds it. garm-provider-aws is Apache-2.0
# (LICENSE = Apache License 2.0, per-file `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`),
# and this patch is contributed under the SAME Apache-2.0 terms so it can be
# upstreamed (RE4 deliverable: "upstream it if accepted"). It:
#   * adds `market_type` (enum: spot), `spot_max_price`, `spot_instance_type`
#     (one-time|persistent), `spot_instance_interruption_behavior`
#     (terminate|stop|hibernate), and `on_demand_fallback` to the per-pool
#     extra-specs (internal/spec/spec.go);
#   * sets EC2 `InstanceMarketOptions{MarketType: spot, SpotOptions{…}}` on the
#     RunInstances call when a pool requests spot (internal/client/aws.go);
#   * implements the on-demand FALLBACK: a spot capacity/price rejection retries
#     the SAME launch on-demand (InstanceMarketOptions cleared) when
#     `on_demand_fallback` is set, so a burst still lands — at on-demand cost —
#     rather than starving the queue;
#   * ships white-box tests (internal/client/spot_test.go) that drive the
#     provider's own EC2-client mock to assert the rendered RunInstances, the
#     fallback path, and that FindInstances excludes interrupted (terminated /
#     shutting-down) spot instances so GARM's reconcile re-queues the job.
# Graceful spot-interruption handling itself is GARM control-plane behaviour
# (GitHub re-queues the job, GARM's DB-as-truth reconcile drops the vanished
# instance); the provider's part is exactly that state-filter, which the patch's
# test pins.
