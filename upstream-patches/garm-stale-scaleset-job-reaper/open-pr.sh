# Open the upstream PR for the garm stale-scale-set-job reaper fix.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - `gh` authenticated (`gh auth status`)
#   - A fork of cloudbase/garm on your GitHub account
#
# Usage:
#   FORK=<your-gh-user>/garm ./open-pr.sh
#
# It clones your fork into a scratch dir, applies fix.patch with `git am` on a
# branch cut from upstream's default branch, adds the accompanying test as a
# second commit, pushes to your fork, and opens the PR against cloudbase/garm
# with PR.md as the body. Review before running.
#
# NOTE ON THE TEST FILE. The test is NOT carried inside fix.patch. It lives at
# ../../checks/garm/stale_scaleset_job_test.go, which is the single source of
# truth: the gate `t_garm_stale_scaleset_job_reaped` injects that same file into
# BOTH a patched and an unpatched GARM tree, so the negative control runs the
# identical assertions. Duplicating it into fix.patch would guarantee drift
# between what we gate on and what we upstream. This script copies it in.

# 2. the test. Two transformations on the way in.
#
#    (a) Strip the metacraft-labs-specific gate preamble from the doc comment —
#        upstream has no `checks/` directory to point at.
#    (b) SCRUB PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE IDENTIFIERS. This file is our gate's
#        source of truth and deliberately carries the real identifiers of the
#        incident it reproduces, which is right for a private milestone but
#        wrong to hand to an unrelated upstream project: the host name is a
#        named production server and `codetracer-ci` is a PRIVATE repository.
#        The numeric run IDs and scale-set UUIDs are opaque and are kept, so
#        the fixture still stands for something concrete. Same rule as PR.md
#        (see ../CLAUDE.md: "written for a public upstream audience — no
#        private infra details"), and the same class of scrub as
#        `chore: scrub recon-grade private names from deployment fixtures/tests`.

git commit -m "Test that reconcileStaleJobs reaps a stale scale set job

Drives the real basePoolManager.reconcileStaleJobs() — directly and via
the real startLoopForFunction() loop — against the real database/sql
store on a real SQLite file, with only the forge mocked. Covers the
positive case, the safety case (a job whose run is still in_progress is
left alone), row accuracy across three rows that all carry
workflow_job_id = 0, and the unchanged workflow-job path.
