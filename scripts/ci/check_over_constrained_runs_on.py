"""RC4 lint — flag OVER-CONSTRAINED ``runs-on`` in consumer workflows.

Campaign: Runner-Fleet-Capability-Pools-And-Remote-Driving, milestone RC4
(gate ``t_ci_runs_on_capability``).

Why this exists
---------------
Under the capability-label taxonomy (RC1,
``metacraft-dev-guidelines/policies/ci-workflow-standards.md``) a CI job requests
the **minimum capabilities it needs** as a label set, and ANY runner advertising
a superset serves it::

    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]            # generic Linux — any host

A job that names a class NARROWER than its real need — a bare single-name
``eph-<os>-<arch>`` class (pinned to one machine), or a capability it does not
actually use (``gpu``, ``x86-64-v3``, ``nested``, a specific hypervisor, …) —
is the exact **starvation-amplifier** the taxonomy calls out: it can only be
served by a strict subset of the fleet, so it queues behind that subset even
when the rest of the fleet is idle. This linter flags those.

What it flags
-------------
For every job's resolved ``runs-on`` label set (matrix ``${{ matrix.<key> }}``
indirection is expanded against ``strategy.matrix``, exactly as the RD2 guard
does):

1. **Bare ephemeral class name** — a single-element ``runs-on`` whose only label
   is a legacy ``eph-*`` class. It must be expressed as a capability label set
   (the migration table in the policy maps each class to its minimum set).

2. **Unjustified narrowing capability** — a label set that requests a
   manifest-derived NARROWING capability (``gpu``, ``nested``, ``docker``,
   ``podman``, ``rr-hw-counters``, ``x86-64-v2/v3/v4``, or a specific hypervisor
   ``incus``/``libvirt``/``hyperv``/``tart``) WITHOUT a documented justification.

The base labels (``self-hosted``, an OS, a CPU arch, and the policy/attested
labels ``ephemeral``/``dev-env-ready``/``org:*``/``benchmark``/…) are never
flagged — they do not narrow routing to specific hardware.

Justifying a genuine need
-------------------------
A job that GENUINELY needs a narrowing capability declares it — file-scoped,
mirroring the ``ci-mainline-exempt`` precedent in the same policy — with a
comment naming the label::

    # cap-justify: gpu (Vulkan visual-replay tests need a real GPU)
    # cap-justify: x86-64-v3 (AVX2 codepath under test)

Each ``cap-justify`` line whitelists ONE narrowing label for the whole file.
A narrowing label with a matching justification passes; one without fails.

Dynamic ``runs-on`` — ``${{ fromJson(needs.choose.outputs.runs_on) }}`` (the RD3
preflight) or any other non-matrix expression — is trusted and skipped: the
reusable workflows parameterise ``runs-on`` via inputs, so their concrete label
set is the CONSUMER's choice and is linted in the consumer repo.

No mock objects: this is a pure text/AST checker over real workflow files. It
reuses the ``runs-on`` resolution from the sibling RD2 guard
(``check_public_repo_runners.py``) so the two linters can never disagree on how
a ``runs-on`` resolves.
