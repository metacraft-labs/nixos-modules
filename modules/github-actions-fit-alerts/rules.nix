# github-actions-fit — Prometheus alert-rule LIBRARY (general, parametric,
# company-agnostic). Runner-Fleet-Capability-Pools-And-Remote-Driving RD4.
#
# A PURE function: given thresholds it returns the YAML text of a Prometheus rule
# file. Both the NixOS module (./default.nix) and the promtool gate
# (../../checks/fit-monitoring.nix) render from THIS one source, so the exact
# text that ships is the exact text `promtool test rules` replays — the lesson
# the deployment-events rules learned the hard way (see the note atop
# infra/services/monitoring/prometheus.nix).
#
# It fires when a workflow does NOT fit the free GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest`
# runner it was moved onto, over metrics from the companion
# github-actions-fit-exporter:
#
#   github_actions_job_duration_seconds{repo,workflow,job,runner_type,visibility}
#   github_actions_job_resource_limit{...,signature=oom|no_space|timeout}
#
# TWO alerts:
#
#   * DURATION REGRESSION — a public-repo, github-hosted job whose duration
#     exceeds `regressionFactor` × its own trailing baseline (a recording rule:
#     avg over `baselineWindow`, offset `baselineOffset` so the baseline excludes
#     the regression itself), AND is above `minDurationSeconds` (so a 2s→5s job
#     never pages). This is "it got slower after the move to ubuntu-latest".
#
#   * RESOURCE LIMIT — a public-repo, github-hosted job hit an OOM / no-space /
#     timeout signature. That is a hard fit failure (the ~14 GB SSD, the 16 GB
#     RAM public-runner ceiling, or the job timeout), so it is the louder page.
#
# Both scope to `runner_type` × `visibility` (defaults github-hosted × public):
# the operator's question is specifically about the PUBLIC repos moved to free
# hosted runners. Widen via the options for private-repo hosted minutes.
