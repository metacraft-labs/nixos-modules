# alertmanager-fleet-routing

A general, parametric **Alertmanager routing** module that makes a runner-fleet's
Prometheus alerts actually **page**. It wraps nixpkgs
`services.prometheus.alertmanager` with an opinionated routing-by-`(severity,
component)` tree, sane grouping + inhibition, and pluggable receivers whose
secrets are always file-referenced.

Delivered for the **`t_fleet_alert_routing`** gate of
`Runner-Fleet-Capability-Pools-And-Remote-Driving` — the missing piece after
**RE1**, which shipped the alert RULES (`garm-fleet-alerts`) with `severity` /
`component` labels that were, until now, only a routing CONTRACT with nothing to
honour them.

## The routing contract

The `garm-fleet-alerts` rules stamp `severity` (`critical` / `warning`) and
`component: garm-fleet` on every alert. This module routes on exactly those:

| Alert labels                              | Routes to                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `severity=critical`                       | the **pager** receiver       |
| `severity=warning`                        | the **CI-ops** receiver      |
| `component=garm-fleet`                    | grouped together into pages  |

The `component=garm-fleet` subtree regroups the fleet's alerts (by `component` +
`severity`) so a burst of runner-chain failures is one page per severity, not one
per alertname — then splits critical→pager / warning→CI-ops. Below it, the same
severity split applies to any other component.

## What is general vs concrete

This module is the **general** half (per the campaign `:repo_layering:`): the
routing OPINION and the option surface, company-agnostic. The **concrete** half —
the real pager (PagerDuty / Slack / email), its endpoint, and its secret — lives
in the operator's private `infra` repo. Metacraft's is
`infra/services/monitoring/alertmanager.nix` (+ its agenix secret).

## Usage

```nix
services.fleet-alert-routing = {
  enable = true;
  # Receiver ENDPOINTS are options; secrets are FILE-referenced, never inline.
  receivers = {
    default = { };
    pager.pagerduty_configs = [
      { routing_key_file = config.age.secrets."alertmanager/pagerduty-key".path; }
    ];
    "ci-ops".slack_configs = [ {
      channel = "#ci-ops";
      api_url_file = config.age.secrets."alertmanager/slack-url".path;
      send_resolved = true;
    } ];
  };
  listenAddress = "127.0.0.1";   # keep OFF the public internet
  port = 9093;
};
```

Then point Prometheus at it (concrete side):

```nix
services.prometheus.alerting.alertmanagers = [
  { static_configs = [ { targets = [ "127.0.0.1:9093" ]; } ]; } ];
```

Receiver kinds: anything Alertmanager understands — `pagerduty_configs`,
`webhook_configs`, `slack_configs`, `email_configs`, … Always use the `*_file`
secret variants (`routing_key_file`, `api_url_file`, `smtp_auth_password_file`).

## Options (highlights)

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `component` | `garm-fleet` | the label whose alerts group together / are inhibited by controller-down |
| `criticalReceiver` / `warningReceiver` / `defaultReceiver` | `pager` / `ci-ops` / `default` | which receiver each severity bucket routes to |
| `receivers` | inert loopback webhooks | pluggable endpoints (override for a real pager) |
| `fleetGroupBy` | `[component severity]` | how the fleet's alerts are grouped into pages |
| `severityInhibit` | `true` | critical squelches warning on same `(component, instance)` |
| `controllerDownInhibit` | `true` | controller-down squelches its dependent `component` alerts (page the cause) |
| `controllerDownSourceMatchers` | `[alertname="GarmControllerDown"]` | which alert counts as controller-down (overridable) |
| `listenAddress` / `port` | `127.0.0.1` / `9093` | Alertmanager web/API bind |

## Inhibition

Two sane defaults, both overridable:

1. **Severity squelch** — a critical alert inhibits a warning alert with the same
   `(component, instance)`.
2. **Controller-down** — a dead controller makes every downstream `garm_*` alert
   fire; the controller-down alert inhibits its dependent `component` alerts on
   the same instance so you page the cause, not the symptoms.

## Testing

The config is rendered by the pure `./config.nix`, so the file `amtool` replays
is the file the host deploys. The gate `.#checks.<system>.t_fleet_alert_routing`
runs `amtool check-config` on the default render and `amtool config routes test`
to assert `critical,garm-fleet → pager` and `warning,garm-fleet → ci-ops` — the
amtool analogue of the promtool contract `garm-fleet-alerts` uses.

## Layering

This is the general module. The concrete routing endpoints, the pager choice, the
Prometheus→Alertmanager wiring and the receiver secret belong in the operator's
private `infra` repo.
