# Pure Alertmanager config RENDERER — the single source of truth for both the
# deployed service (../alertmanager-fleet-routing/default.nix -> the NixOS
# module) and the build-time gate (../../checks/alertmanager-routing.nix ->
# packages.fleet-alertmanager-config). Same lesson as garm-fleet-alerts/rules.nix:
# the file `amtool check-config` / `amtool config routes test` replays is the
# EXACT structure the host deploys, because both come from here.
#
# It is company-agnostic. The routing OPINION is baked in — route by
# `severity` (critical -> the pager receiver, warning -> the CI-ops receiver)
# and group the fleet's alerts together by their `component` label — while the
# receiver ENDPOINTS are parameters, so a pager can be PagerDuty / a webhook /
# Slack / email, always with its secret referenced by FILE (never inlined).
