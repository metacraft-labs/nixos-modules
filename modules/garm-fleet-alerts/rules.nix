# GARM runner-fleet Prometheus alert-rule LIBRARY (general, parametric,
# company-agnostic).
#
# This is a PURE function: given a set of thresholds it returns the YAML text of
# a Prometheus rule file. Both the NixOS module (./default.nix) and the promtool
# gate (../../checks/fleet-alerting.nix) render from THIS one source, so the
# exact text that ships is the exact text `promtool test rules` replays.
#
# It covers every failure mode in a GARM runner chain, mapped to metric names
# VERIFIED live on a real controller (high-mem-server :9997, 2026-09-08):

#
# LISTENER LIVENESS: a scale-set controller opens ONE message session per scale
# set and long-polls it. A worker whose session dies and is never re-opened logs
# NOTHING — no error, no warning, no backoff — so the arithmetic above is the
# only signal there is (2026-09-02: four days of dead listeners, silent). See
# the `garm-fleet-listeners` group and the README section of the same name; note
# in particular that POOL mode is webhook-driven and opens no message sessions
# at all, which is why the declared count takes pools only where there are no
# scale sets.
#
# RC5 OVER-PROVISION: a thundering-herd watch for the pools cutover — runners
# CREATED / jobs SERVED over a window (`garm:overprovision_ratio`), which sits
# near 1 in the coordinated central-GARM pool topology and spikes when a
# provider spins up runners that never serve a job. See the
# `garm-fleet-overprovision` group.
#
# Plus the two checks `garm_*` CANNOT see, over metrics published by the
# companion external-checks exporter (../garm-fleet-external-checks):
#
#   github_app_installation_token_mint_ok{app}             -> App key/JWT rejected
#   github_webhook_last_delivery_ok{org,hook_id}           -> webhook delivery broken
#   probe_success{job=~webhookProbeJobRegex}               -> public endpoint down (blackbox)
#
# SCALE-SET vs POOL. The live fleet is in scale-set mode today, so the capacity
# metrics are `garm_scaleset_*`. `mode = "pool"` flips them to `garm_pool_*` for
# after the Phase-C migration. The simple renames (status/max/min) are exact; the
# STARVATION join is genuinely different between the two modes (scale sets expose
# `desired_runner_count` and a `name` that equals the job's requested class;
# pools do not), so the pool-mode starvation expression is a documented, coarser
# owner-scoped variant — see `poolSaturatedExpr`.

  # DECLARED LISTENERS. One message session per SCALE SET. Pools are counted
  # only on controllers that declare no scale sets, and that is deliberate, not
  # laziness: MEASURED on the two live controllers 2026-09-15, a POOL-mode GARM
  # opens no message sessions at all — high-mem-server:9997 exports 18
  # `garm_pool_info`, `garm_webhook_received` (8368 valid), and ZERO
  # `garm_github_operations_total{operation=~".*MessageSession|GetMessage"}`
  # series, because pool mode is webhook-driven.
  #
  # BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THE `unless` BUYS. A pool-ONLY controller is already
  # excluded from the shortfall alert by vector matching alone: with no
  # message-session counters there is no garm:message_sessions_live series on
  # that instance, and `declared - live` over a missing right-hand side is
  # EMPTY, not `declared - 0`. So counting its pools would NOT by itself page
  # forever (verified 2026-09-15 against the live fleet: both the shipped
  # expression and a naive `count(garm_scaleset_info or garm_pool_info)` variant
  # return zero series). It would page forever only if the live term ALSO
  # defaulted an absent creates counter to zero — which is exactly the mistake
  # the `or 0 * <creates>` arm below invites on the delete term, so the risk is
  # real but conditional.
  #
  # What the `unless on (instance)` actually prevents is a MIXED controller —
  # one exporting both families — having its pools added on top of its scale
  # sets, which would invent a permanent phantom shortfall there, because pools
  # open no sessions to cover the inflated expectation. It also keeps the count
