# Prove that the Nix configuration this action just wrote actually TOOK EFFECT.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The `eph-*` runner images ship Nix pre-installed. `cachix/install-nix-action`
# detects that, prints "Aborting: Nix is already installed", and exits 0 — a
# reported success that never applied `extra_nix_config`. Every later `nix`
# call in the job then dies with:
#
#     error: experimental Nix feature 'nix-command' is disabled;
#            add '--extra-experimental-features nix-command' to enable it
#
# An installer that no-ops into a broken configuration and calls it success is
# a check reporting accurately about the wrong thing. This action does not have
# that particular bug — its `Configure Nix` step writes nix.conf unconditionally,
# whether or not it installed Nix. But "we wrote a file" is not "the setting is
# in effect", and the gap between those two is exactly where the original defect
# lived. The file can silently fail to apply when:
#
#   * `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `NIX_CONF_DIR` points somewhere other than
#     `$HOME/.config/nix`, so the write lands where Nix will not read it;
#   * `NIX_CONFIG` is set in the environment and overrides the file;
#   * a system-level `/etc/nix/nix.conf` or the daemon rejects the setting;
#   * `nix` is not on PATH at all in the steps that follow.
#
# In every one of those cases the write "succeeds" and the job still dies later.
# So this script verifies the ENVIRONMENT, not the write.
#
# HOW IT VERIFIES
# ---------------
# Deliberately by FUNCTIONAL PROBE first, and deliberately WITHOUT passing
# `--extra-experimental-features` on the probe command line. Asking Nix to
# report its own config is circular here: `nix config show` is itself gated on
# `nix-command`, so any invocation able to answer the question has already been
# handed the feature it was asked to check for. The probes below therefore run
# a plain `nix` command that simply cannot work unless configuration alone
# enabled the feature — the same way a real later step would fail.
#
# Both probes are offline: they evaluate a literal and a zero-input local flake,
# so this never depends on a substituter, the network, or a lock file.
#
# Only after `nix-command` is proven to work from configuration alone do we call
# `nix config show` — at that point it is legitimately callable — to check the
# remaining requested features individually. That catches the partial case
# (e.g. `nix-command flakes` applied but `pipe-operators` dropped), which a
# coarse "does any nix command run" probe would wave through.
#
# SECRETS: this script never prints the contents of nix.conf, netrc, or
# NIX_CONFIG. Those carry `access-tokens` and netrc credentials. It reports only
# whether such an override is *present*, and the paths involved.

This is the "installer silently no-opped" failure class. Nix is present, this
action reported that it configured it, but the requested experimental features
are NOT in effect — so the next `nix` call in this job would have died with an
unrelated-looking error, far from the real cause.

Do NOT work around this by adding `--extra-experimental-features` to individual
nix invocations; that hides the same defect one call at a time. Fix the reason
the configuration did not apply (see the diagnostics above — most often
XDG_CONFIG_HOME/NIX_CONF_DIR pointing away from the file this action wrote, or
a NIX_CONFIG environment override).
