#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Contract test for `.github/setup-nix/verify-nix-config.sh`.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT VACUOUS
# -------------------------------------------
# The defect being guarded against is an installer that no-ops on a runner where
# Nix is ALREADY present, reports success, and leaves `experimental-features`
# unapplied. A test that only exercised the healthy path would pass just as
# happily with no guard at all, which is the same "check reporting accurately
# about the wrong thing" failure the guard exists to end.
#
# So each negative case here does two things in order:
#
#   1. FIXTURE MUTATION CHECK — first prove the fixture genuinely reproduces the
#      defect, by running a plain `nix` command under it and requiring that the
#      command fails the way a real job step would. If the fixture cannot break
#      Nix, the case is declared broken rather than silently passing.
#   2. GUARD CHECK — only then require that verify-nix-config.sh exits non-zero.
#
# Without step 1, a change that made the fixture inert (say, Nix ignoring
# NIX_CONFIG) would turn every negative case into a green no-op.
#
# The suite additionally asserts that action.yml actually INVOKES the guard, so
# deleting the step from the action fails this test rather than quietly
# restoring the original silent-success behaviour.
#
# The native-Darwin service-PATH regression uses real executables rather than
# mocks: a temporary bin directory contains the real Nix and every external
# utility the guard uses except grep. A mutation with the portability bootstrap
# removed must reproduce the old false missing-feature report, then the real
# guard must pass under that identical PATH. This proves both that the fixture
# can trigger the defect and that the fix covers the service environment.
