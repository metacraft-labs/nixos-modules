  # Windows-Runner-Binary-Cache-Deploy M7 prereq (c) gate:
  # t_repro_deploy_agent_https_converges.
  #
  # A genuine TWO-NODE proof that the production nixos-modules wiring serves the
  # reprobuild binary cache over REAL HTTPS with a publish ALLOWLIST enforced,
  # and that the reprobuild deploy agent PULLS a signed desired-state manifest
  # over REAL TLS, verifies its ECDSA-P256 signature against the allowed-signers
  # set, and converges — while a manifest signed by a NON-allowlisted key is
  # rejected. Nothing is stubbed: real OpenSSL TLS on both the cache daemon and
  # the manifest host, real ECDSA-P256 signature verification in the agent.
  #
  #   * node `server` runs the M7-extended `services.mcl-repro-binary-cache`
  #     over HTTPS (self-signed ECDSA-P256 cert via LoadCredential) with an
  #     `--allowed-signers` allowlist, PLUS an nginx TLS vhost serving the
  #     signed RDM1 manifest fixture at https://server/latest.rdm.
  #   * node `agent` runs `services.mcl-repro-deploy-agent` targeting
  #     `windows-runner-001`, pointed at the HTTPS manifest source, trusting the
  #     server's self-signed CA (REPRO_BINARY_CACHE_CA_FILE) and the manifest
  #     signer's ECDSA-P256 pubkey.
  #
  # The manifest + allowed-signers fixtures are REAL: minted once with a tiny
  # Nim helper against reprobuild's own `repro_deploy_agent` +
  # `repro_peer_cache/auth` libraries (see :fixture-provenance: in the check
  # body), so the signature the agent verifies is a genuine ECDSA-P256 signature
  # over the genuine RDM1 envelope, and the trusted anchor is the matching
  # 130-char-hex uncompressed public key.
