  #
  # gate: t_garm_capability_placement
  #
  # Proves fleet-aware placement + capability→host mapping HERMETICALLY. A
  # `services.garm.capabilityPools` entry is a LOGICAL, host-agnostic pool
  # ("provision capability X on every host that PROVES X, balanced by policy Y");
  # the reconcile EXPANDS it into one concrete GARM pool per QUALIFYING provider,
  # placement driven entirely by the RA6 capability manifests. This is the
  # structural fix for the "GPU servers 95% idle vs hms saturated" imbalance.
  #
  # Same hermetic shape as t_garm_pools_labels: ONE real garm.service + reconcile
  # + minimal mock GitHub + three DUMMY providers carrying DISTINCT manifest
  # fixtures — hms (NO gpu), gpu-001 & gpu-002 (gpu). Candidate order is the
  # provider attr order (sorted): gpu001, gpu002, hms.
  #
  # ASSERTIONS:
  #  (1) CAPABILITY PLACEMENT: a capabilityPool requiring `gpu` expands to pools
  #      ONLY on the qualifying GPU hosts (gpu001, gpu002) — NOT hms. A job
  #      needing gpu is therefore placeable only on a qualifying host.
  #  (2) BALANCED GENERIC: a generic capabilityPool (requires linux/x64/x86-64-v3,
  #      which ALL three prove) expands across ALL THREE hosts — a generic job is
  #      no longer pinned to one host but balanced across the least-loaded
  #      qualifying hosts.
  #  (3) SPREAD balancer: the generic pools all get the SAME priority (distribute
  #      across equivalent hosts).
  #  (4) PACK balancer: a packed capabilityPool's per-host pools get DESCENDING,
  #      DISTINCT priorities in candidate order (one host fills before the next).
  #  (5) The expansion is manifest-driven end to end: each expanded pool's tags
  #      are that host's derived label set (gpu pools carry `gpu`, hms does not).
