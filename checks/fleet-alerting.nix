  # Proves the GARM runner-fleet alert-rule library (../modules/garm-fleet-alerts)
  # is VALID and FIRES for every runner-chain failure mode, with fault-injection
  # tests — WITHOUT the infra repo. It renders the default-threshold rules
  # (packages.garm-fleet-alert-rules), then runs:
  #
  #   promtool check rules   — the rules parse + are structurally valid.
  #   promtool test rules    — each alert fires on a replayed incident and stays
  #                            silent through a transient (../modules/garm-fleet-alerts/
  #                            tests/fleet-alerting.test.yml).
  #
  # This is the same promtool contract infra's `just check-alert-rules` uses, so
  # a rule that is unfirable-by-construction (the deployment-events failure mode)
  # cannot land here either.
