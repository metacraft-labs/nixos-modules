  # Both run WITHOUT the infra repo and WITHOUT the real GitHub API. The only
  # mock is the GitHub boundary itself: RD3's live-billing branch shells to a
  # stub `gh` (justified — hitting the real billing API from a hermetic build is
  # impossible and would need a privileged token); the org-variable and
  # visibility branches — the production default path — use no mock at all. RD2
  # is a pure text/AST checker over real workflow files, no mock.
