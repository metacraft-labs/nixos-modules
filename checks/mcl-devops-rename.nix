# API-M1 — the enforcement half of the `mcl` -> `mcl-devops` rename.
#
# metacraft-specs/infrastructure/metacraft-cli.md §2.5 rules that the
# deprecation shim FAILS rather than forwards, and names three rules that make
# the transition safe.  Two of them are declarations elsewhere (the throwing
# `packages.mcl` alias in packages/default.nix, and the failing `bin/mcl` stub
# inside `mcl-devops`); the third is this file:
#
#   "That ordering is enforced, not remembered.  A repository check asserts
#    that exactly one package in the estate provides `bin/mcl`, and that
#    during the window it is the stub.  A check makes the ordering structural;
#    a note in a milestone does not."
#
# Plus the milestone's own falsifier, `test_no_stale_mcl_references`, which is
# an ABSENCE assertion and therefore worthless on its own: a search that has
# never found anything has not been shown to be capable of finding anything.
# Both checks below plant a hit -- a stale reference, and a second provider of
# `bin/mcl` -- and assert that the SAME code path which produced the green
# result finds it, in the same run.
